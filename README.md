In this assignment, you will finish the CoffeeRun app and modify the RemoteDataStore module to
work with FIREBASE as a back end.
Complete the following:
1. If you have not yet completed Chapter 12 (Form Validation), work through that chapter to add
form validation.
2. Work through Chapter 13 (Ajax) to connect CoffeeRun to the back-end service at
http://coffeerun-v2-rest-api.herokuapp.com/api/coffeeorders.
3. Using Firebase, create a new Firebase app for CoffeeRun, using the data sent to the API
hosted on Heroku as a guide.
4. Modify scripts/remotedatastore.js as necessary to use Firebase as CoffeeRunâ€™s new back-end.
Note the following...
- You may need to change the way that orders are created.
- Any changes you make should not affect the code outside remotedatastore.js.
- As with the Heroku API, access the collections over HTTP.
5. Push the contents of your project to a new GitHub repository using a git client (e.g., the git
command-line client, GitHub desktop. Do not submit files using drag-and- drop onto the repository
web page, and do not push this assignment to the same repository as your previous homework
assignments
